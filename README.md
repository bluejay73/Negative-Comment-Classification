Doing a multi-label classification I have used a three approaches:
1.Normal Logistic Regression approach using scikit-Learn Libraries.
2.Bi-gru stacked with Bi-lstm with max pooling Approach using keras backend tensorflow.
3.Attention Mechanism with GRU using keras and manual functions with backend theano.
python version=2.7
keras version=2.1.2
tensorflow version=1.4.0
theano version=1.0.4
